This repository is intended to let you, the wider Oblivious user group, to have your say in our product direction. We would love to get your say in the feature you need to take the greatest advantage of confidential compute, whether that's for internal data governance, data collaboration, or deploying APIs that your users can trust.

### How to get started

Simply open a new issue in this repo and ask a question, or suggest a feature request. Our team will be on it immediately and keep you in the loop as it progresses into the next release. We currently make updates every 5 weeks, so that's a good expected turn around time to keep in mind (unless it's a very quick fix).

### Reporting vulnerabilities

This is not the place to report a vulnerability. For the safety of our users, we would request you submit the issue via our bug bounty program on BugCrowd here and read more about the program [here](https://docs.oblivious.ai/concepts/security_vulnerabilities). Depending on the CVSS score, we will even give out rewards! The reason for this is so that we have time to patch the issue before it has a chance to act as a threat to other users. All patches are of course disclosed.
